# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a hard working individual who is ready to learn. What motivates me the most is my 
  great deaI of curiosity. This allows me to grasp concepts very easily, especially when it 
  comes to technology. I am looking for the opportunity to use my technical and marketing 
  background to help a company excel. 

  For this reason, I would love an opportunity in which I can delve into the art of 
  computer-human interaction and UI/UX design.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
